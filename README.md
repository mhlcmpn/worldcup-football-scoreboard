# Notes
Initial project tasks break down:
* project skeleton
* configure logging
* start match feature
  * validate that teams names cannot be null
  * validate that homeTeam <> awayTeam
  * score is 0-0
  * same match cannot be started multiple times
  * match is visible on the scoreboard
  * match name comparison should be case-insensitive
* update score feature
  * scores are positive numbers
  * match is still in progress
* finish match feature
  * match is removed from the scoreboard
  * score cannot be updated once the match was finished
* summary of in-progress (live) matches
  * summary includes only in-progress matches
  * matches are ordered according to requirements
* concurrency
  * in the same time multiple games can be started and finished

I chose ConcurrentHashMap instead of CopyOnWriteArrayList because of the frequent writes that might be needed for updating the scores.

Initially I have added logback as dependency to have proper logs, but I realized that by doing it i do not offer the library user 
the possibility to use a logger provider of his choice.
